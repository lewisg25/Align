# Align 🌿
### *Stay in sync. Grow together.*

**Align** is a relationship-focused web application designed to help couples bridge the gap between the busyness of daily life and the need for deep emotional connection. By providing a dedicated space for shared check-ins and intentional dialogue, Align ensures that partners don't just coexist—they evolve together.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Daily Check-ins:** Quick, guided prompts to gauge how you and your partner are feeling mentally and emotionally.
* **Reflective Logs:** A shared space to document milestones, gratitude, or thoughts on the relationship.
* **Intentional Conversations:** Curated conversation starters designed to move past "How was your day?" and into "How are we doing?"

## 🚀 Why Align?
In a world of endless digital distractions, our most important relationships often get the "leftover" energy. Align was built on the principle that **consistency beats intensity**. Small, daily moments of alignment prevent long-term drift.
